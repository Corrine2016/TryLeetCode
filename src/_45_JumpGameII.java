Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

For example:
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

Note:
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.*/

//思路是，curReach表示当前能跳到的最远距离，lastReach表示上次最远可以跳到的距离。
//那么，对于每次lastReach < i 时，说明跳上一次不到i，需要cnt++
